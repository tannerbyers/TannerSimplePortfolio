# Tools I use:
* Visual Studio Code
* Git 
* [Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

And I use this link for reference:

My current "blogging platform" is hugo. It is a simple static site generator in which you can make a new post with the below simple command:

 {{< highlight Go>}}
 hugo new post/new-postname.md
{{< / highlight >}}

I will update this as I add more tools to my blogging workflow.
