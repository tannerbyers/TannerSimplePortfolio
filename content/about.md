# Hey There, I'm Tanner Byers!

## Current Stack
**ReactJs, ExpressJs, SQL, Python, Java, CucumberJs** 

I currently work as a **Software Engineer** at [Availity LLC](https://www.availity.com/) working on lots of different projects (CucumberJS test for legacy codebase, Creating edit logic in Java, writing scripts to automate repititve tasks). 

This blog was created to solve the problem of finding a convenient place to share my thoughs, ideas, and projects.

In my free time, I'm either coding [side projects](https://github.com/tannerbyers), spending time with my beautiful family, or trying to play some D&D. Reach out to with the below links to connect!
