# I'm a programmer with a passion for healthcare.

This blog was created so that I can easily share information in the form of blog posts or my portfolio for prospective employers. 

I currently work as a **(Technical) Business Analyst Associate** at [Availity LLC](https://www.availity.com/). Everyday I am learning new facets of the healthcare industry and applying my programming knowledge to create efficient workflows for mundane business task. I work mostly with X12 Data and create edit maps for our internal editing solutions and code edit logic in Javascript. 

I'm also always working on new projects with my spare time (they can be found here: [Github](https://github.com/tannerbyers)). 

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions! ✉️
