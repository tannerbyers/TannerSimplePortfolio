# Hey There, I'm Tanner Byers!

## Current Stack
**ReactJs, CucumberJs, ExpressJs, PostreSql, Python**

I currently work as a **Software Engineer I** at [Availity LLC](https://www.availity.com/) and have been developing with CucumberJs to create regression tests for our team.

This blog was created to solve the problem of finding a convenient place to share my thoughts, projects, and accomplishments. 

In my free time, I'm either coding [side projects](https://github.com/tannerbyers), spending time with my beautiful family, or trying to play some D&D. Reach out to with the below links to connect!
